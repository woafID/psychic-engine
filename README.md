#### Notes:
- Designer is not working super well yet, because the display of curves is glitched in all 3 programs. However if you're fine with relying on the actual strokes displayed instead of the usual blue guidelines, then it could be usable.
- In Photo, display of the brush stroke preview is buggy, but it doesn't prevent usage.
